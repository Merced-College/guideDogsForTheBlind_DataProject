# guideDogsForTheBlind_DataProject
Reviewing procedural programming using some data from Guide Dogs for the Blind, and then applying OOD principles to make the code more resuable.

For this problem you will read in data from a file that has records for Guide Dogs, for Guide Dogs for the Blind.  There is a header on the file, and each row is a record for a different dog.  There are 3 fields for each dog; Phase, Dog and Sex.  

You are to use the code in this repo as starter code and add to it.

The code reads in the data into the Dog objects, and creates and array of Dogs.  It has a function to find the count of the number of dogs that are in a certain given phase.  

You should print out a table that shows the count of number of dogs that are in phases 1-9, here is an example of what the table should look like:

Phase   count\
1       	9\
2       	16\
3       	5\
4      	 7\
5       	4\
6       	4\
7       	12\
8       	17\
9       	0 

Next make two functions, the first that returns the percentage of female dogs, and another function that returns the percentage of male dogs.  

Call these 2 functions in main and print out the results.

For the Thinking Question you should print out the counts for all of the phases, including phases that have a letter and not just a number.
